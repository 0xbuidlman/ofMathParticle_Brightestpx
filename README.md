# ofMathParticle_Brightestpx
Openfrmeworks Math/Particles example modified to track the brightest pixel in ofVideoGrabber, so you can use something bright in front of the camera and interact with the particles.

The code that I've added on top of [particlesExample](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/examples/math/particlesExample) is complete gibberish, I'm using the tutorial http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/image_processing_computer_vision.html to track the brightest pixel, and I've replaced ofImage with ofVideoGrabber.
I've used maxBrightnessX and maxBrightnessY as the new coordinates in the particles example.
It works most of the time :)

This is my first time using C++, so be gentle, I come from a web frontend background, so this is my graduation :p
